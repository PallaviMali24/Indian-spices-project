Our Vision
Our vision is to produce natural food and food products and make it available to as many people as possible in Kerala.
The products are handpicked to ensure the highest quality.
We will be a one-stop solution for all-natural foods and food products.
We will never use artificial flavours or colours, preservatives. adulterants or plastic.
In five years, we envisage a SPICEBASKET farm that offers memberships to buyers and allows them to visit for a few days, take part in the production process, and experience the all-natural lifestyle first-hand
