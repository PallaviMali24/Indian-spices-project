<h3><p>Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several tree species from the genus Cinnamomum.<br>
 Cinnamon is used mainly as an aromatic condiment and flavouring additive in a wide variety of cuisines, sweet <br>
and savoury dishes, breakfast cereals, snack foods, teas, and traditional foods. The aroma and flavour of cinnamon <br>
derive from its essential oil and principal component, cinnamaldehyde,<br>
 as well as numerous other constituents including eugenol.</br></p>
