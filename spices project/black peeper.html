<p><h3>
                      Cinnamon is a spice obtained from the inner bark of several tree species from the genus Cinnamomum.
 Cinnamon is used mainly as an aromatic condiment and flavouring additive in a wide variety of cuisines, sweet 
and savoury dishes, breakfast cereals, snack foods, teas, and traditional foods. The aroma and flavour of cinnamon 
derive from its essential oil and principal component, cinnamaldehyde
 as well as numerous other constituents including eugenol.</div>
